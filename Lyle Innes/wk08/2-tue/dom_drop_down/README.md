# DOM Drop-Down

Your must complete two tasks using JavaScript:
1. Update the drop down box to show the five cities NYC, SF, LA, SYD, ATX.
2. When you select a city in the drop-down box, the background image should change to show that city. The images for the five cities are in the git repo. We have already provided the css code for changing the background image in the style.css file (at the bottom). Use those classes.
